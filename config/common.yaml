# VOLATILE_DURABILITY_QOS: Past samples are ignored and a joining
#  DataReader receives samples generated after the moment it matches

# TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY_QOS: When a new DataReader joins, its
#  History is filled with past samples.

# BEST_EFFORT_RELIABILITY_QOS: It indicates that it is acceptable not
#  to retransmit the missing samples, so the messages are sent without
#  waiting for an arrival confirmation. Presumably new values for the
#  samples are generated often enough that it is not necessary to
#  re-send any sample. However, the data samples sent by the same
#  DataWriter will be stored in the DataReader history in the same
#  order they occur. In other words, even if the DataReader misses some
#  data samples, an older value will never overwrite a newer value.

# RELIABLE_RELIABILITY_QOS: It indicates that the service will attempt
#  to deliver all samples of the DataWriterâ€™s history expecting an
#  arrival confirmation from the DataReader. The data samples sent by
#  the same DataWriter cannot be made available to the DataReader if
#  there are previous samples that have not been received yet. The
#  service will retransmit the lost data samples in order to
#  reconstruct a correct snapshot of the DataWriter history before it
#  is accessible by the DataReader.
